Here is the desktop version of the well-known Sudoku Game.

The user can make his own moves, erase them and fill it again. When they wish to know the solution they can use the solver to solve it for them. The solver works on a backtracking algorithm going through all possible solutions. This game is built using pygame in python.

```
pip install pygame
```
